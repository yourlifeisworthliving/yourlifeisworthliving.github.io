I know you are struggling. But one thing you should know, your life is worth living. You can trust me on that.

Please don't take your life. Stick around.

If you have a friend who you think might be struggling, be there for them. If you feel like you don't have a friend in your life like this right now I want you to know that I see you. I believe in you. I want you to experience all this life has to offer. Please don't go anywhere.

Are you struggling in life? You have no one to share your story?

I am here to listen to you. Feel free to send me your story via e-mail at [writetome@yourlifeisworthliving.com](mailto:writetome@yourlifeisworthliving.com). I promise to read each and everyone of you.

I love you.
