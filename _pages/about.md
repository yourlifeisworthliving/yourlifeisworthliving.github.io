I know you're struggling. I know you're feeling alone. But let me tell you. There are many just like you. The world is big.

Whether you are being bullied, struggling with your studies or accepted that you have chosen the wrong career. Whether you just lost a loved one, broke up with the one you thought you'd spend the rest of your life or accepted that you're part of the LGBTQ+ family.

I want you to know you're not alone. I want to reach out and give you a hug. You matter to me and you deserve to find happiness. I want you to smile and experience love. But for now, you need to trust me.

There are far, far better things ahead. And what you're enduring is going to define you. It is going to make you the bravest, the fiercest, the strongest and the proudest you've ever been.

Please do not surrender your life. Stick around.

It gets better.

__I love you.__

If you have a friend who you think might be struggling, be there for them. If you feel like you don't have a friend in your life like this right now I want you to know that I see you. I believe in you. I want you to experience all this life has to offer. Please don't go anywhere.

### If you have no friend to share your story, I just want to let you know I'm here.
