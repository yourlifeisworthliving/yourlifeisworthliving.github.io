I know you are struggling. I want to give you a hug you. I want you to experience happiness. I want you to smile and experience true love. But I need you to trust me.

There are far, far better things ahead. And what you're enduring is going to define you. It is going to make you the bravest, the fiercest, the strongest and the proudest you've ever been.

I want you to know that you're not alone in this world. Whether you just lost a loved one, broke up with the one you thought you'd spend the rest of your life or accepted that you're part of the LGBTQ+ family.

Please do not end your life. Stick around.

If you have a friend who you think might be struggling, be there for them. If you feel like you don't have a friend in your life like this right now I want you to know that I see you. I believe in you. I want you to experience all this life has to offer. Please don't go anywhere.

If you have no friend to share your mind, I just want to let you know I'm here.

I am here to listen to you. Feel free to get in touch at [writetome@yourlifeisworthliving.com](mailto:writetome@yourlifeisworthliving.com). I promise to read each and everyone of you.

I love you.
